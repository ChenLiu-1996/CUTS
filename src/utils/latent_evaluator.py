class LatentEvaluator(object):
    """
    Evaluate the latent representation of the unsupervised segmentation model.

    NOTE: As of now, a lot of the functionalities of this class is no longer used.
    It is most often used just as a numpy file saver...
    We off-sourced most of the segmentation and analysis to other files under `script_analysis`.

    Metrics used:
        Dice coefficient.

    @params:
    `segmentation_paradigm`
        Options implemented

        1. 'kmeans_point':
            [Baseline as in WACV submission]
                In this method, the segmentation is performed using PHATE + K-means clustering.
                We are using some weak supervision: 1 pixel per image.
            Overview:
                Hypothetically, the users would provide 1 pixel of annotation per image,
                and our method will provide binary segmentation that "guesses" the desired foreground.
            Detail:
                For each image, we extract the pixel-level embeddings and perform K-means clustering,
                leading to a K-class label map.
                Then, we use the single-pixel annotation (center pixel of ground truth mask by implementation)
                to identify the desired label ID, and compare that label to the ground truth.

        2. 'diffusion_null':
            [New method with Diffusion Condensation]
                In this method, the segmentation is performed using diffusion condensation.
                We are not using any supervision at all (and hence not providing something too meaningful).
            Overview:
                Hypothetically, the users would provide no annotation,
                and our methods will provide multi-class segmentation that separates distinct features,
                without even trying to "guess" what the desired foreground is.
            Details:
                For each image, we extract the pixel-level embeddings and perform hierarchical clustering using
                using diffusion condensation. By formulating the pixels as nodes in a graph and defining
                connectivity using affinity, we can assign labels to each connected component, which can be
                seen as multi-class segmentation.

                The evaluation is hand-wavy and probably overrepresents the power of the method:
                We evaluate the segmentation individually using the "best matching" label IDs.

        3. 'diffusion_point':
            [New method with Diffusion Condensation]
                In this method, the segmentation is performed using diffusion condensation.
                We are using some weak supervision: 1 pixel per image.
            Overview:
                Hypothetically, the users would provide 1 pixel of annotation per image,
                and our method will provide binary segmentation that "guesses" the desired foreground.
            Details:
                For each image, we extract the pixel-level embeddings and perform hierarchical clustering using
                using diffusion condensation. By formulating the pixels as nodes in a graph and defining
                connectivity using affinity, we can assign labels to each connected component, which can be
                seen as multi-class segmentation.
                Then, we use the single-pixel annotation (center pixel of ground truth mask by implementation)
                to identify the desired label ID, and compare that label to the ground truth.

        4. 'diffusion_distill':
            NOTE: Out of these paradigms, this is the most realistic and useful,
            and meanwhile the most challenging.
            [New method with Diffusion Condensation]
                In this method, the segmentation is performed using diffusion condensation.
                We are using some weak supervision: 1 mask per dataset.
            Overview:
                Hypothetically, the users would provide 1 ground truth mask for 1 image,
                and our methods will provide the corresponding binary segmentation for the rest
                of the images in the dataset by "best matching" the desired foreground.
            Details:
                For each image, we extract the pixel-level embeddings and perform hierarchical clustering using
                using diffusion condensation. By formulating the pixels as nodes in a graph and defining
                connectivity using affinity, we can assign labels to each connected component, which can be
                seen as multi-class segmentation.
                For the 1 image whose ground truth mask is provided, we use its mask to estimate the desired label IDs.
                For the rest of the images in the dataset, we generate their respective multi-class segmetation
                label maps in the same manner, and try to estimate which label IDs are corresponding to the
                desired label IDs in the annotated image.

    `pos_enc_gamma`:
        Weighting for positional encoding.
        Only relevant to the Diffusion Condensation paradigms.
    `save_path`:
        Path to save numpy files and image files.
    `multiprocessing`:
        Whether or not we parallel process the job for speedup.
        NOTE: Don't use it. The code is correct but it can easily
        cause memory problems. At least on our server.
    `num_workers`:
        For multiprocessing.
